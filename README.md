# zGreending
The browser that protects you from onlookers 

# Can you guess what's going on on the other tabs?

Of course not! Therefore, no one does!

If someone sees your tabs (even accidentally) on Chrome or Firefox, this reveals tons of unnecesary information

zGreending does <b>not</b> reveal this information, with its numerated tabs
<br>

Even the Description in the taskbar can reveal unnecesary information to others

zGreending only displays "Greending" on the taskbar

There is no history in zGreending, protecting you from onlookers that want to know what you search

The history button/option is nowhere to be found. That's because it doesn't exist.

The Download manager is inexistent mostly because of its dangers. The Download manager also reveals crucial information about the user. That's why there's no Download manager in zGreending
